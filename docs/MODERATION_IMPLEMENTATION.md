# Moderation & UX Feedback Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of moderation and UX feedback improvements for the Scanémon application, addressing edge cases and giving users more control over their experience.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Report Endpoint Implementation
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/moderation/report`
- **Purpose**: Allow users to report issues with scans
- **Features**:
  - Logs scan ID + reason for report
  - Supports multiple report reasons (incorrect identification, technical issues, inappropriate content, spam, other)
  - Optional description field for additional context
  - Tracks reporter information (user ID, IP, user agent)

### 2. Moderation Queue System
- **Database Models**: 
  - `ModerationQueue` - tracks reports and their status
  - `UserFeedback` - tracks user feedback and satisfaction
- **Status Management**: pending → reviewed → resolved/dismissed
- **Features**:
  - Manual review workflow
  - Moderator notes and timestamps
  - Report statistics and analytics

### 3. Enhanced Retry UX
- **Retry Logic**: 
  - 10-second delay on first retry
  - 20-second delay on second retry (backoff)
  - Maximum 2 retry attempts
- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Automatic retry with delays
  - Visual feedback during retry process
  - Retry count tracking

### 4. Improved UI Messaging
- **New Action Buttons**:
  - "🔄 Try Again" - retry with same image
  - "📷 Use Different Image" - suggest alternative approach
  - "🚨 Report Issue" - report problems to moderation
- **Contextual Display**: Only shown when retry is suggested
- **User Feedback**: Tracks user actions for analytics

### 5. Moderation Dashboard
- **Page**: `/moderation` - dedicated moderation interface
- **Features**:
  - View pending reports
  - Update report status
  - Add moderator notes
  - View statistics and analytics
  - Filter and manage reports

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### Models (`api/app/models/moderation.py`)
```python
class ModerationQueue(Base):
    # Tracks reports with status, reason, timestamps
    # Links to scan analytics and users

class UserFeedback(Base):
    # Tracks user feedback and satisfaction scores
    # Links to scan analytics
```

#### Service (`api/app/services/moderation_service.py`)
```python
class ModerationService:
    # create_report() - Create new reports
    # update_report_status() - Update report workflow
    # log_user_feedback() - Track user actions
    # get_report_statistics() - Analytics and metrics
```

#### Routes (`api/app/routes/moderation.py`)
- `POST /report` - Create reports
- `GET /reports` - List reports
- `PUT /reports/{id}` - Update report status
- `POST /feedback` - Log user feedback
- `GET /stats` - Moderation statistics
- `GET /queue` - Moderation queue

#### Enhanced Scan Endpoint
- Added `retry_count` parameter
- Returns retry suggestions and delays
- Tracks retry attempts in analytics

### Frontend Components

#### Enhanced ScanPage (`app/src/pages/ScanPage.tsx`)
- Retry functionality with delays
- Report modal with reason selection
- Feedback tracking for user actions
- Improved error handling and UX

#### New ModerationPage (`app/src/pages/ModerationPage.tsx`)
- Dashboard for moderators
- Report management interface
- Statistics and analytics display
- Status update workflow

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Moderation Endpoints
```
POST   /api/v1/moderation/report          # Create report
GET    /api/v1/moderation/reports         # List reports
PUT    /api/v1/moderation/reports/{id}    # Update report
POST   /api/v1/moderation/feedback        # Log feedback
GET    /api/v1/moderation/stats           # Moderation stats
GET    /api/v1/moderation/feedback/stats  # Feedback stats
GET    /api/v1/moderation/queue           # Moderation queue
```

### Enhanced Scan Endpoint
```
POST   /api/v1/scan/?retry_count={n}     # Scan with retry tracking
```

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### 1. Better Error Handling
- Clear retry suggestions
- Progressive delays to prevent spam
- Multiple resolution options

### 2. User Control
- Report issues directly from scan results
- Choose between retry or different approach
- Provide feedback on scan quality

### 3. Transparency
- Visible retry counts and delays
- Clear status indicators
- Feedback confirmation

### 4. Moderation Workflow
- Structured report management
- Moderator notes and timestamps
- Status tracking and analytics

## 🔍 Testing

### Test Script (`test_moderation.py`)
- Tests all moderation endpoints
- Verifies retry functionality
- Validates data flow and responses

### Manual Testing
- Frontend retry flow
- Report creation and management
- Moderation dashboard functionality

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Creating a Report
```javascript
// Frontend
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/moderation/report', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    scan_id: 123,
    reason: 'incorrect_identification',
    description: 'Card was identified as wrong Pokémon'
  })
});
```

### Retry with Backoff
```javascript
// Frontend automatically handles retry with delays
const handleRetryScan = async () => {
  const delaySeconds = scanResult?.retry_delay_seconds || 10;
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delaySeconds * 1000));
  await handleScan(nextRetryCount);
};
```

### Moderation Workflow
```python
# Backend - Update report status
moderation_service.update_report_status(
    report_id=123,
    status=ReportStatus.RESOLVED,
    moderator_id=456,
    moderator_notes="Fixed the identification issue"
)
```

## 📈 Analytics & Metrics

### Tracked Metrics
