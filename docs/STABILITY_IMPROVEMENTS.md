- **Retry Limits**: Maximum 3 attempts per operation
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications during retry attempts

#### Context-Aware Retry
- **Scan Retries**: Different strategies for scan failures
- **Auth Retries**: Appropriate fallback for auth failures
- **API Retries**: Network-aware retry logic

### 6. **User-Friendly Error Messages**

#### Contextual Guidance
- **Scan Errors**: Specific guidance for image quality issues
- **Network Errors**: Clear offline mode explanations
- **Auth Errors**: Helpful sign-in troubleshooting

#### Progressive Disclosure
- **Error Severity**: Low, medium, high, critical levels
- **Actionable Advice**: Specific steps users can take
- **Recovery Options**: Multiple paths to resolve issues
