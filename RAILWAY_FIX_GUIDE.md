# üîß Railway Deployment Fixes - Complete Guide

## üö® Issues Fixed

### 1. **Environment Variable Corruption**
**Problem**: Unicode escape sequences and null bytes in environment variables causing startup failures.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `railway_start.py` with comprehensive environment sanitization
- Removes null bytes, control characters, and Unicode escape sequences
- Sanitizes ALL environment variables, not just critical ones
- Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 2. **Database URL Protocol Issues**
**Problem**: Railway sometimes provides `postgres://` instead of `postgresql://`.

**Solution**:
- Automatic protocol conversion in `railway_start.py`
- Database URL sanitization and validation
- Better error handling for database connection issues

### 3. **Startup Script Configuration**
**Problem**: `railway.toml` pointing to wrong startup script location.

**Solution**:
- Updated `railway.toml` to use `cd api && python railway_start.py`
- Enhanced startup script with dependency checking
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. **Docker Configuration Issues**
**Problem**: Gunicorn configuration causing deployment failures.

**Solution**:
- Updated `Dockerfile.railway` to use `railway_start.py` directly
- Added health checks for better monitoring
- Non-root user for security
- Better dependency management

### 5. **Missing Dependencies**
**Problem**: Some required packages missing from Railway requirements.

**Solution**:
- Updated `requirements.railway.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- Added monitoring and logging packages
- Updated to latest stable versions

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Step 1: Prepare Repository
```bash
# Ensure all files are committed and pushed to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Create Railway Project
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `scanemon` repository

### Step 3: Add Database
1. In Railway project, click "New"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway provides `DATABASE_URL` automatically

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
Add these in Railway project settings:

**Required Variables:**
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

**Optional Variables (with defaults):**
```bash
DEBUG=False
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
ENABLE_CORS=True
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
ENVIRONMENT=production
ENABLE_SWAGGER=False
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Step 5: Deploy
Railway will automatically:
- Build from `api/Dockerfile.railway`
- Use `api/railway_start.py` for startup
- Deploy to port 8000
- Provide public URL

## üîç Monitoring Deployment

### Success Indicators
Look for these messages in Railway logs:
```
üöÄ Starting Railway deployment...
üîç Checking dependencies...
‚úÖ All core dependencies available
üßπ Sanitizing environment variables...
‚úÖ Sanitized X environment variables
‚úÖ Database URL validated and cleaned
‚öôÔ∏è Setting up Railway environment...
üåê Starting server on 0.0.0.0:8000
üìä Health check available at: http://0.0.0.0:8000/health
```

### Test Endpoints
Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app.railway.app/` (root)
- `https://your-app.railway.app/health` (health check)
- `https://your-app.railway.app/docs` (API docs - disabled in production)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check Railway logs for specific error messages
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.railway.txt`
   - Verify Python 3.11 compatibility

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
   - Check for null bytes in environment variables
   - Verify PostgreSQL service is running

3. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - The startup script now automatically sanitizes all environment variables
   - Check logs for sanitization messages
   - Ensure no special characters in environment variable values

4. **Port Issues**
   - Railway uses port 8000 by default
   - Ensure `API_PORT=8000` is set
   - Check that no other services are using the port

5. **CORS Errors**
   - Verify `CORS_ORIGINS` includes your frontend domain
   - Check `ENABLE_CORS=True` is set
   - Ensure frontend is making requests to the correct Railway URL

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click on your service
   - Check the "Logs" tab for detailed error messages

2. **Test Health Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
   ```

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - The startup script logs all environment variable sanitization
   - Look for "üßπ Sanitizing environment variables..." messages

4. **Check Dependencies**
   - The startup script checks dependencies before starting
   - Look for "üîç Checking dependencies..." messages

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Database Connection Pooling
```bash
DB_POOL_SIZE=10
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=20
DB_POOL_RECYCLE=3600
```

### Caching Configuration
```bash
CACHE_TTL=3600
CACHE_MAX_SIZE=1000
```

### Rate Limiting
```bash
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
```

## üîí Security Enhancements

### Environment Variable Sanitization
- Removes null bytes and control characters
- Sanitizes Unicode escape sequences
- Validates critical environment variables

### Docker Security
- Non-root user in container
- Minimal base image (python:3.11-slim)
- Health checks for monitoring

### Production Settings
- Disabled Swagger docs in production
- Enhanced logging
- Security headers enabled

## üìà Monitoring and Logging

### Enhanced Logging
- Structured logging with emojis for better visibility
- Detailed error messages with stack traces
- Environment variable sanitization logging

### Health Checks
- Built-in health check endpoint at `/health`
- Docker health check for container monitoring
- Railway health check path configuration

### Performance Monitoring

- Request/response logging
- Error tracking and reporting

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** using the updated configuration
2. **Monitor logs** for successful startup messages
3. **Test endpoints** to ensure everything works
4. **Update frontend** to use the new Railway URL
5. **Set up monitoring** for ongoing maintenance

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test the health endpoint to ensure the service is running
4. Review the troubleshooting section above

The enhanced logging and error handling should provide clear information about any issues that arise during deployment.
